# ShitCoin!
this shit look nasty asf!

### Idea
Cryptocurrency that is PoW based on a distributed NN which validates the transactions.
The entire network of nodes collaborates on the model, which verifies each transaction.
The NN decides which miner/worker is the most trustworthy (lmao) and gives them the block reward.
